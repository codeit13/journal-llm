Today was a mixed day. I woke up feeling a bit tired after staying up late working on my project. I had a meeting with Sarah from marketing about the upcoming product launch, which went better than expected. She had some great ideas that I think will really help us connect with our target audience.

After lunch, I took a walk in the park to clear my head. The weather was beautiful, and I saw several people walking their dogs. It made me think I should get a pet sometime - maybe a cat since they're lower maintenance.

When I got back to the office, I had to deal with an issue in the codebase that Tom introduced yesterday. It was frustrating trying to figure out what went wrong, and I spent about two hours fixing it. I wish he would test his code more thoroughly before pushing changes.

On my way home, I stopped by the grocery store to pick up ingredients for dinner. I made pasta with a new recipe I found online, and it turned out pretty good! I'm proud of myself for cooking instead of ordering takeout again.

Before bed, I called my mom to check in. She mentioned that my sister might be moving to a new city for a job opportunity. I'm happy for her but also a bit sad that she'll be even further away. We used to be so close when we were younger.

Tomorrow I need to finish the presentation for the client meeting and schedule a dentist appointment that I've been putting off for weeks. I'm a bit anxious about both, but I know I'll feel better once they're done.
